* 🧠 LLMs that reason step-by-step using tools (ReAct or OpenAI Functions)
* 🧩 Modular prompt chains, tools, memory, and retrievers
* 💬 Chat-based apps with reasoning or insight generation

**Ideal for:**

* Conversational analytics with tool calls
* Knowledge agents (RAG + Tools)
* Function-calling interfaces (MCP)

**Example:**

> "Show me top customers" → tool call → returns table → LLM responds

## 🔗 LangGraph (by LangChain team)

**LangGraph = LangChain + DAG + State Management**

**Use LangGraph when you want:**

* ⛓️ Structured workflows with branches, retries, or parallelism
* ⚙️ Nodes that act as agents, retrievers, or evaluators
* 🔄 Control over state and transitions (e.g., finished, retry, error)

**Ideal for:**

* Workflow-like AI automation (e.g., "extract", "reason", "summarize")
* Multi-step agent systems with different tools per step
* High-availability tasks with controlled state

**Example:**

```
User → Ingestion Node → Tool Node → Reason Node → Respond Node
```

LangGraph is **more reliable** and easier to debug for production apps than bare LangChain agents.
