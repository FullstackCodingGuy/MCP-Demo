## üîë CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Data is king** ‚Üí Learn to derive maximum signals from raw transaction data.
2. **ML is the engine** ‚Üí Build explainable, fine-tuned models per use case.
3. **APIs & Dashboards are the interface** ‚Üí Deliver insights as a service.
4. **Security & Compliance is mandatory** ‚Üí Protect all PII and financial data.

## üß© STEP-BY-STEP PLAN TO BUILD THE MODEL PLATFORM

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Understand the Customer Transaction Data**

Typical fields:

```json
{
  "customer_id": "XYZ123",
  "transaction_date": "2024-12-01",
  "amount": -250.75,
  "merchant": "Amazon",
  "category": "eCommerce",
  "mode": "Credit Card",
  "location": "Bangalore",
  "remarks": "Grocery essentials"
}
```

You must extract:

* **Spend patterns** (amount, frequency, category)
* **Financial behavior** (recurring payments, risk appetite, income detection)
* **Lifestyle segments** (travel, luxury, EMI, health)
* **Cash flow trends** (income inflow, net savings, overdrafts)

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Data Engineering Pipeline**

| Stage         | Details                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ingestion     | API feeds, bank exports, UPI statements                         |
| Cleaning      | Remove duplicates, standardize merchant names                   |
| Enrichment    | Tag merchants ‚Üí categories using NLP or lookup                  |
| Aggregation   | Daily/weekly/monthly aggregates, rolling stats                  |
| Feature Store | Create reusable features (last 3-month spend, % income to rent) |

Tools: **Airflow, dbt, Pandas, Spark, Feast**

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Build Inference Models by Use Case**

| Use Case                 | ML Technique                       | Sample Features                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Churn Prediction         | Classification (XGBoost, LightGBM) | Txn count trend, drop in login activity            |
| Alternate Credit Scoring | Regression / Ranking               | Avg monthly income, EMI patterns, default history  |
| Spend Forecasting        | Time Series (Prophet, LSTM)        | Past N months' spend, seasonal trends              |
| Lifestyle Segmentation   | Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)       | Spend category mix, ticket size, frequency         |
| Anomaly Detection        | Isolation Forest, Autoencoders     | Unusual txn amounts/categories                     |
| Goal-based Planning      | Recommendation                     | Detect life events (e.g., marriage, car loan need) |

üëâ Always include **model interpretability (SHAP, LIME)** for business trust.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Model Training & Deployment Pipeline**

| Stage               | Tools                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Experiment Tracking | MLflow, Weights & Biases                    |
| Model Packaging     | `joblib`, ONNX, TorchScript                 |
| Serving             | FastAPI + Uvicorn / Triton Inference Server |
| Versioning          | Git + DVC                                   |
| Retraining Triggers | Drift detection, monthly schedule           |

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Inference as a Service API Layer**

Design modular endpoints:

```http
POST /api/v1/inference/churn-score
POST /api/v1/inference/spend-forecast
POST /api/v1/inference/segment
POST /api/v1/inference/credit-score
```

üîí Secure with:

* API Keys
* OAuth2 tokens
* JWT per customer/user

Support:

* Batch mode (CSV upload)
* Real-time (per transaction)

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Client-Specific Customization**

Your platform should allow:

* Custom rules (e.g., NBFC-specific churn thresholds)
* Plug-and-play models per customer segment
* UI/UX white-labeling for dashboards

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Business Dashboard & Analytics Layer**

Use tools like **Streamlit, Metabase, Superset** or build a **Next.js** based UI.

Include:

* Visuals for predictions + alerts
* Model confidence + explainability
* CSV export, PDF reports
* Drill-down by customer, region, segment

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **Security, Privacy, Compliance**

| Area           | Actions                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| PII Handling   | Masking, tokenization                               |
| Data Storage   | Encrypted at rest (AES-256)                         |
| Inference Logs | Anonymized audit logs                               |
| Access         | RBAC, client-specific data partitions               |
| Compliance     | GDPR, PCI DSS, RBI Digital Lending, SOC 2 readiness |
