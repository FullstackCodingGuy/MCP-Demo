I see there's an issue with the customer management page. Let me fix that first, then test the feature engineering page: I need to handle the edge case where pagination might be empty. Let me fix this: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me refresh the dashboard by accessing it again: Great! Now let me create a simple test to verify that all features are correctly documented. Let me also create a summary of the feature counts: Let me use a different approach: Let me check this directly by counting the features from the header I already read:

The customer features we have are:
1. customer_id (identifier)
2. days_since_last_transaction
3. days_since_first_transaction  
4. customer_lifetime_days
5. total_transactions
6. unique_merchants
7. unique_categories
8. unique_locations
9. avg_transactions_per_day
10. avg_transactions_per_week
11. avg_transactions_per_month
12. total_amount
13. avg_transaction_amount
14. median_transaction_amount
15. std_transaction_amount
16. min_transaction_amount
17. max_transaction_amount
18. total_expenses
19. avg_expense_amount
20. max_expense_amount
21. expense_transaction_count
22. total_income
23. avg_income_amount
24. max_income_amount
25. income_transaction_count
26. net_cash_flow
27. income_expense_ratio
28. savings_rate
29. grocery_total_spend
30. grocery_transaction_count
31. grocery_avg_amount
32. restaurant_total_spend
33. restaurant_transaction_count
34. restaurant_avg_amount
35. gas_total_spend
36. gas_transaction_count
37. gas_avg_amount
38. retail_total_spend
39. retail_transaction_count
40. retail_avg_amount
41. entertainment_total_spend
42. entertainment_transaction_count
43. entertainment_avg_amount
44. grocery_spend_percentage
45. restaurant_spend_percentage
46. gas_spend_percentage
47. retail_spend_percentage
48. entertainment_spend_percentage
49. most_frequent_category
50. avg_transaction_hour
51. most_common_hour
52. weekend_transaction_ratio
53. most_common_day
54. weekend_weekday_spending_ratio
55. monthly_spending_trend
56. monthly_frequency_trend
57. spending_volatility
58. frequency_volatility
59. most_used_payment_mode
60. payment_mode_diversity
61. location_diversity
62. most_common_location
63. merchant_loyalty_score
64. top_merchant
65. small_transaction_ratio
66. medium_transaction_ratio
67. large_transaction_ratio

That's **66 total columns, with 65 actual ML features** (excluding customer_id).

Transaction features:
1. transaction_id (identifier)
2. customer_id (identifier)  
3. amount
4. abs_amount
5. is_first_transaction
6. days_since_last_transaction
7. amount_vs_avg_ratio
8. frequency_last_7_days
9. frequency_last_30_days
10. merchant_seen_before
11. category_seen_before
12. location_seen_before

That's **12 total columns, with 10 actual ML features** (excluding transaction_id and customer_id).

Let me update the documentation to reflect the correct numbers: 
```

Now let me test the feature engineering page by creating a quick test script to ensure all functionality is preserved: 

Made changes.

Let me check if the servers are still running and test the functionality directly: Let me check if the terminal processes are still active: Perfect! The API server is running and working correctly. Let me create a final comprehensive summary and test the feature engineering page: 

Made changes.

Perfect! Let me also quickly verify that the feature engineering page can be accessed by opening the dashboard: ## 🎉 Feature Engineering Documentation - Implementation Complete!
