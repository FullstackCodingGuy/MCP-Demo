## 🏗️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Prediction Algorithm Components:**

```python
# Simplified churn prediction logic
def predict_churn(customer_features):
    # Recency Risk (40% weight)
    recency_score = days_since_last_transaction / 60
    
    # Frequency Risk (25% weight)  
    frequency_score = 1 - (total_transactions / 200)
    
    # Monetary Risk (20% weight)
    monetary_score = abs(negative_spending_trend) / 1000
    
    # Engagement Risk (15% weight)
    engagement_score = 1 - (unique_merchants / 20)
    
    # Weighted combination
    churn_probability = (
        recency_score * 0.4 +
        frequency_score * 0.25 + 
        monetary_score * 0.20 +
        engagement_score * 0.15
    )
    
    return churn_probability, risk_level, confidence
```

### **Risk Level Classification:**
- **High Risk**: 70%+ churn probability → Immediate intervention
- **Medium Risk**: 40-70% churn probability → Proactive engagement  
- **Low Risk**: <40% churn probability → Regular maintenance

### **Feature Importance Hierarchy:**
1. **days_since_last_transaction** (28%) - Most critical predictor
2. **monthly_spending_trend** (18%) - Spending trajectory indicator
3. **total_transactions** (15%) - Activity level measurement
4. **avg_transaction_amount** (12%) - Spending behavior pattern
5. **unique_merchants** (8%) - Usage diversity indicator
